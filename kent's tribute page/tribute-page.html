        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Kent Harvey Lacno (June 17, 2006 - *insert random death date*) is an ordinary guy. Born in the Land of the Morning called the Philippines, he was raised there to a certain degree of poverty for the entirety of his toddlerhood. Around the age of 4, his father got a job in Singapore, so his family migrated there. There he lived for three years, encompassing most of his childhood, until he immigrated back to the Philippines due to the high living costs in Singapore.<p>

          <p>He started elementary at a small private school. Throughout his elementary years, he experiences what other people have experienced. The fireworks during New Year's, the birthday cakes during his birthdays. The sporadic visits to his favorite Fast Food restaurant called Jollibee. The slow yet significant growth of consciousness and awareness. Hardships that range from small arguments to recovering from natural disasters. He had laughed, had cried, had loved, had feared.</p>

          <p>What could be considered different from his experience with other people's experiences is that he was raised to think he's special. His identity was further reinforced through his constant achievements in academics and extracurricular activities, garnering several medals and certificates in the process.</p>

          <p>After graduating from elementary, he realized he was bored. So he enrolled at another school under a special program that gathered competent students around a single class section. This program was called the Special Science Class program. He aced the entrance exams and interview, and there he was to continue proving that he was special.</p>

          <p>He didn't. He started to realize that he wasn't special. He had grown awareness and began to comprehend the complexity of the world. He isn't only a person in his little bubble he can call his world. It was an entire ocean with many fishes, corals, and sharks. This realization shocked his identity. He wasn't so special after all.</p>

          <p>This realization was further emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stuck within the confines of his own home, his only true company is himself. He starts to think a lot. He thinks about mundane stuff like how he wasn't brushing his teeth enough. He also gives himself existential crises by asking questions about his purpose. Because if he wasn't special, then what really was the point?</p>

          <p>He decided to go on a journey of self-help: meditating, affirmations, journaling, reading, etc. They may seem like the bright light at the end of the tunnel, but they were pretentious he thought. The self-help industry, he meant. He finds the idea of competing to read more books absurd because what's the point of reading more books if you don't understand any of them?</p>

          <p>In the sea of pretentious self-help, some genuinely helped him out. Up until today, he's been journaling every day. Reading non-fiction eventually led him to discover reading fiction, and he found fiction personally much more enjoyable and informative of the world.

          <p>He also stumbled across a life philosophy that to this day he still stands by called absurdism. Everything is weird and absurd, absurd to the point that it doesn't make sense. Yet, that is okay. It is absurd that we were born into this world with no purpose, but if we have no purpose, we could simply create our own. Live life despite its absurdities, he realized.</p>

            <p>Later on, he landed a software development internship at a start-up company. A small salary, he complained. It's okay since what he's looking forward to is the experience. And after a year, it's sufficient to say that he had learned a lot. He also discovered, and rediscovered, a variety of hobbies. Playing the piano, programming, learning a new language, gaming, etc.</p>

            <p>That's it for his life, so far. It's not a happy or sad ending. I mean how could it be? His life is only just beginning. He has come a long way since then, and yet he still has a long way to go. So we wish him luck in his future endeavors.</p>
